## Election-Audit Summary
This is an excellent script that does not much modification at all to be used for any election. There are two major modifications that must be made for it to be functional though.
One modification is the loading path. Below is the code:
	# Add a variable to load a file from a path.
	file_to_load = os.path.join("Resources", "election_results.csv")

election_results.csv related to the comma-separated values that I used and Resources related to the folder the file was in. These will need to be altered to fit the new files.

Another modification is the loading path. Below is the code:
* file_to_save = os.path.join("results", "election_results.txt")
This relates to the text file that I created with the analysis. This will need to be altered if you do not want to overwrite your analysis of previous election results. 

A last modification must be made to where the code receives it's values from the csv file. Below is the code:
* candidate_name = row[2]
* county_name = row[1]

These rows numbers will have to be altered if the csv file of other elections do not place the candidate name and county name in the same location
